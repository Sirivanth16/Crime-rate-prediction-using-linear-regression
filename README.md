The main objective of our project is to predict the Crime Rate in different regions using specific parameters like density, country, crime rate, central etc. In this project we considered a dataset of a particular Country. The region we selected is the United States of America. We used Linear Regression model to predict the crime rate. Finally a graph is plotted after implementing Linear Regression. A graph is plotted between density and crime rate to enhance distribution of crime rate in a particular region.
